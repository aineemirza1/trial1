Country and Territory Reports
What is God’s Will?
God wants us to live in peace and happiness on a paradise earth forever!
You may wonder, though, ‘How could that ever happen?’
Just as a good father wishes the best for his children, our heavenly Father desires that we enjoy eternal happiness.
God wants us to walk in his paths.
The Bible says that our Creator wants to “instruct us about his ways” so that we can “walk in his paths.”
We invite you to find out by means of this brochure.
What Sort of People Are Jehovah’s Witnesses?
How many of Jehovah’s Witnesses do you know?
Some of us may be your neighbors, work colleagues, or classmates.
Or we may have engaged you in Bible discussions.
Who really are we, and why do we publicly share our beliefs?
We are ordinary people.
We come from various backgrounds and social conditions.
Some of us formerly practiced a different religion, while others did not believe in God.
Before becoming Witnesses, however, all of us took the time to examine carefully the teachings of the Bible.
We agreed with what we learned, and then we made a personal choice to worship Jehovah God.
We benefit from studying the Bible.
Like everyone else, we have to deal with problems and our own weaknesses.
But by trying to apply Bible principles in our everyday lives, we have experienced a marked improvement in our quality of life.
That is one reason why we share with others the good things that we have learned from the Bible.
We live by godly values.
What values have the Witnesses learned from studying the Bible?
Why Are We Called Jehovah’s Witnesses?
Many people think that Jehovah’s Witnesses is the name of a new religion.
However, over 2,700 years ago, the servants of the only true God were described as his “witnesses.”
Until 1931, we were known as Bible Students.
Why did we adopt the name Jehovah’s Witnesses?
It identiﬁes our God.
According to ancient manuscripts, God’s name, Jehovah, appears thousands of times in the Bible.
In many translations this name has been replaced by titles, such as Lord or God.
Yet, the true God had revealed himself to Moses by his personal name, Jehovah, saying: “This is my name forever.”
In this way, he distinguished himself from all false gods.
We are proud to bear God’s holy name.
It describes our mission.
Just as an individual may bear witness in court in behalf of an innocent person, we are determined to make known the truth about our God.
We are imitating Jesus.
Jesus himself said that he ‘made God’s name known’ and kept ‘bearing witness to the truth’ about God.
Christ’s genuine followers must, therefore, bear Jehovah’s name and make it known.
This is what Jehovah’s Witnesses are endeavoring to do.
Why did the Bible Students adopt the name Jehovah’s Witnesses?
For how long has Jehovah had witnesses on earth?
Who is the greatest Witness of Jehovah?
How Was Bible Truth Rediscovered?
The Bible foretold that after the death of Christ, false teachers would arise among the early Christians and corrupt Bible truth.
In time, that is exactly what happened.
A Bible was needed that gives credit to its Author.
